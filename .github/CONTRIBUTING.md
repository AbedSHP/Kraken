# Kraken Development Guidelines
Contributing to the Kraken project is generally straight forward but there are some guidelines that should be followed.

## Python
In general follow the rules laid out by the PEP8 article except that variable names in Kraken are lower-camel case and don't use underscores in the names.

All methods need to have doc strings. **ALL**. Doc strings are to be formatted using the Google Python Style.
